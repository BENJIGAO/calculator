This repository contains a webpage that functions as a calculator. However, it's no ordinary calculator. Although there's the basic features of of pressing buttons which corresponds to certain actions that can be viewed on the display, it also has keyboard support and can deal with many special cases that may or may arise (most likely won't but I wanted to be thorough). I also tried to make it visually appealing. If there's anything that I should change, I'd love to know. I hope you like it!
