# Calculator with Keyboard Support

This repository contains a webpage that functions as a calculator. However, it's no ordinary calculator. Although you can press buttons which correspond to certain buttons on a calculator that carry out certain functions, it also has keyboard support so you can use it efficiently at the convienience of your keyboard. Moreover, the calculator can deal with many special cases that may or may arise (most likely won't but I wanted to be thorough). I also tried to make it visually appealing. If you have any feedback, I'd love to know. I hope you like it!
